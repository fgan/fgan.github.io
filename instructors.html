        <h1 class="bold col-md-12">Our Instructors</h1>
        <p class="col-md-12">We're a small team of university-graduate professionals operating an educational startup in South Korea. In 2015, our fellow UC Berkeley alumni friends established an intensive English conversational program for international graduate students and scholars in Berkeley, California. Their success led us to adopt a similar model. We chose Seoul as the launching point for our educational efforts because of its perfect setting to exchange our cultural heritages, languages, and professional experiences.</p>
